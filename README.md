Coming back from not making anything on Github for so long. I'm going to start making meditation stuff from he "calm" app. Listening to a meditation and punching up the script. Also, I wanna meditate everyday from now on till the end of time. I just realized something that I want to try out. Maybe I can make a repository about all of the Meditation scripts that I receive everyday and then I will code every script. I'll call it "Meditation Scripts via Calm". I'll go ahead and try it out, and I'll check back in to let you know if it worked or not.
